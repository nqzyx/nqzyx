I have been a software developer/engineer for a very long time -- more than four (4) decades. It all started in my college days in the late 1970's when programming languages were almost never cross-platform or, when they were, had specialized syntax on each platform. The language(s) changed very slowly -- only once every few years -- and any code needed for a solution was hand-written (i.e., there was no GitHub, NPM, NuGet, etc.) This was a far cry from today's world of software development. 

I was first paid to write software in 1980 or 1981 when I wrote a retail inventory program for a college professor who owned a boot store using AppleSoft BASIC on an Apple IIe. I cannot remember how much I was paid for that code, but I had found my passion.

Now, I should say that I have never been a competitive programmer. I have always been more interested in building things than solving puzzles. I have also never been a big fan of competitive programming contests for whatever reason.

These days, I am approaching retirement. Among my six (6) adult offspring there are four who have become software engineers. I never pushed them toward this profession. In fact, they all traveled unique paths to get here.

- Never degreed or even formally trained, the eldest began writing code in a high school work-study program activating an insatiable appetite for knowledge, never even considered anything other profession, and is now a world-class open source visionary in the space industry. 
- After completing a CS degree, the youngest -- a Presidential Scholar in mathematics -- interned with Amazon and then went to work for a consulting agency and is now an accomplished technical and team lead.
- "Dos de Seis" (aka, "Two of Six" <g>) completed a degree in Spanish, studied abroad, taught high school Spanish, became the Language department head then decided to leave education, enroll in an intensive Code Camp with the next sibling, and then switched careers becoming an accomplished full-stack developer in the educational software space.
- After a few years adrift on the sea of self-discovery, the New Yorker decided to enroll in the same session of Code Camp with "Dos de Seis" and went has become a talented full-stack developer specializing in data visualation and championing the causes of the un(der-)represented. This one might have missed a calling to the legal profession.

Each of them makes me proud. Each of them is far more more talented and skilled than I had ever hoped to be at their age... and who knows, maybe the remaining two (youngest) siblings will follow in their footsteps someday. You never know...
